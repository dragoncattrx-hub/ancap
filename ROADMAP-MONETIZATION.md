# ANCAP Monetization-First Roadmap

> Status: supporting strategy note | Updated: 2026-05-25
> Source of truth for execution priority: `MASTER_ROADMAP.md`
> This file now serves as monetization strategy context. The first ACP-first revenue loop exists; the remaining work is monetization depth, not a greenfield monetization thesis.
> Fast status index: `docs/STATUS_MATRIX.md`

## Thesis

ANCAP should stop presenting itself mainly as an abstract AI/Web3 showcase and move toward a product that directly sells useful AI-driven crypto workflows, machine-readable proofs, and agent-to-agent paid execution.

Core formula:

**AI task -> crypto payment -> verified result -> receipt/proof -> repeat run / subscription / marketplace fee**

This keeps ANCAP in the safer zone of selling software and AI services for crypto teams and agents, instead of drifting into promises of investment returns or regulated financial products.

---

## Primary Goal

The first ACP-first revenue loop is already in place in baseline form. The current monetization goal is to deepen and de-risk it:

1. improve payment quality and conversion
2. add creator withdrawal and earnings visibility
3. add subscription and referral payout mechanics
4. deepen paid API monetization and reporting
5. add marketplace discovery and dispute/refund flows
6. keep ACP-first as the core unit while adding lower-friction adapters later where needed

## May 2026 Execution Plan: What To Keep, Add, And Defer

The broad product-improvement research is useful, but ANCAP should not implement every generic recommendation. The immediate monetization path is narrower:

**North Star:** weekly paid workflow GMV in ACP.

### Keep in the active roadmap

1. **Conversion and checkout clarity**
   - Make `home -> workflow -> checkout -> receipt` obvious.
   - Show price, expected output, sample report, execution time, and proof expectation before payment.
   - Track workflow view, checkout start, paid run, completion, and repeat run.

2. **ACP-first payment quality**
   - Keep ACP as the primary accounting unit.
   - Improve payment intent states: invoice, pending, confirmed, failed, receipt.
   - Avoid adding broad multi-currency support until ACP checkout is stable.

3. **Creator and seller economy**
   - Let AI agents and workflow creators define, publish, and monetize paid workflows.
   - Prioritize seller dashboard metrics: published workflows, paid runs, revenue in ACP, conversion, receipt completion.
   - ANCAP earns from marketplace take rate, premium placement, and execution fees.

4. **Proof Center as the trust layer**
   - Every paid run should produce a shareable receipt URL.
   - Receipts should include workflow slug, price snapshot, input hash, status timeline, output items, and ledger/proof metadata.
   - Make receipts readable by humans and external AI agents.

5. **Agent/API monetization**
   - Treat `/developers` as a product page, not only documentation.
   - Expose paid API endpoints, spend caps, 402-compatible payment terms, and machine-readable receipts.
   - Maintain AI-readable catalog surfaces such as `/llms.txt` and `/agent-products.json`.

6. **Telegram and X acquisition loop**
   - Use free token snapshots as the cold-traffic entry point.
   - Upsell to Token Risk Report Pro, Launch Pack, and premium workflow bundles.
   - Reward referrals after first captured paid run, not after registration.

### Add now

- AI-readable product catalog for agents.
- Sample reports for premium workflow SKUs.
- Creator workflow publishing flow.
- Seller dashboard revenue attribution.
- Public receipt/proof pages for paid runs.
- Basic funnel and revenue analytics by SKU, bundle, creator, and API endpoint.

### Defer

- Native mobile app.
- Physical product after-sales features.
- Large integration marketplace.
- Heavy A/B testing platform before traffic volume justifies it.
- Complex personalization before basic role-based journeys are polished.
- Broad multi-currency checkout before ACP payment quality is strong.

### Six-week implementation sequence

1. **Week 1: Conversion and trust**
   - Workflow cards, sample reports, checkout state, receipt expectation, public AI-readable catalog.
2. **Week 2: Creator economy MVP**
   - Create workflow, define schema, set price, publish/unpublish, seller dashboard basics.
3. **Week 3: Proof receipts**
   - Shareable receipt page, proof center indexing, machine-readable receipt schema.
4. **Week 4: Developer/API monetization**
   - Paid endpoint packaging, API key CTA, spend caps, 402-compatible response shape.
5. **Week 5: Acquisition**
   - Free token snapshot, paid report upsell, Telegram/X referral links, first-paid-run referral reward.
6. **Week 6: Scale**
   - Premium workflow ranking, creator payouts, Telegram bot-lite, revenue dashboards.

## Working Principle

Do not build another vague crypto front page.
Build revenue loops first, then deepen the protocol and agent economy behind them.

If a feature does not clearly support one of these loops, it is probably not first-priority:
- pay-per-run
- campaign/service package
- agent API payment
- treasury/payout fee

---

## Current Session Execution Plan

1. Write this roadmap into the repo.
2. Reposition the homepage toward paid AI workflows and proof-backed results.
3. Add a first workflow catalog page in the frontend.
4. Then wire the page into navigation and CTA flow.
5. After that, move to backend workflow-template endpoints.
