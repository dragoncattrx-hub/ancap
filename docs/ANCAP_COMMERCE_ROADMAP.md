## Positioning

**ANCAP = AI-workflow commerce + crypto/stablecoin payments + proof receipts + marketplace + developer/MCP API**

## Shipped in this track (repo)

### ANCAP Pay (`/v1/pay`, `/v1/merchant`)
- Payment links, invoices, credits checkout, merchant dashboard, CSV export
- Webhook event: `merchant.payment.captured`

### Top-up & trust
- `/buy-acp`, `/wallet/top-up` → Stripe credits
- `/explorer`, `/status`, `/reserves` (stub)

### Workflow Store 2.0
- Bundles: `compliance-pack`, `growth-pro-pack`, `merchant-qr-pack`

### Claim codes
- `POST /v1/claim-codes/create`, `POST /v1/claim-codes/redeem`, UI `/claim`

### Developer / agents
- MCP server: `mcp-server/ancap_mcp_server.py`, docs `/mcp`
- Paid API hardening: `GET /paid-api/challenge`, `POST /paid-api/settle`, `POST /paid-api/consume`
- Payment scanner: `POST /payment-scanner/parse` (manual confirm required)

### Site map
`/pay`, `/invoices`, `/merchant`, `/claim`, `/mcp`, `/reserves`, `/workflow-store`, `/creators`, `/business`, `/compliance`

## Beyond 90 days - SpaceX encrypted satellites

Long-horizon infra: launch satellites with **encrypted ANCAP edge servers** via **SpaceX** (rideshare/manifest), sealed storage, ground HSM control plane, then ACP orbital-edge productization.
