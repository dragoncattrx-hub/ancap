# CoinGecko listing playbook — ANCAP rails (wACP / ACP / sACP)

Status: **ready to submit for wACP only after liquidity is raised**. Native ACP and sACP are not CoinGecko-listable yet for the reasons below.

## Place now (no CoinGecko approval)

## Critical naming rule

Do **not** apply as ticker **`ACP`**.

- CoinGecko already lists an unrelated asset as **ACP** ([Arena Of Faith](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arena-of-faith)).
- Official ANCAP BSC market asset is **`wACP`** (Wrapped ACP), BEP-20.
- Native **ACP** is the ANCAP L1 coin (`acp1…`) — not an EVM contract; CoinGecko cannot treat it as a BEP-20 listing.
- **sACP** — submit only after mainnet deploy + tracked market (see `docs/STABLECOIN_SACP_SPEC.md`).

List as:
- **Name:** Wrapped ACP  
- **Symbol:** wACP  
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)

## Current market truth (blocker)

GeckoTerminal already indexes the token (not yet linked to a CoinGecko coin id):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Token | `0x349797E2f1A4FD722Af2dB181ab1C4ED7606F402` |
| Pool | `wACP / USDT` PancakeSwap V2 `0xF391ca2bcBaB93Afa23326ebF1e35DB950841601` |
| GeckoTerminal pool | <https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/pools/0xf391ca2bcbab93afa23326ebf1e35db950841601> |
| GeckoTerminal API | `GET https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2/networks/bsc/tokens/0x349797e2f1a4fd722af2db181ab1c4ed7606f402` |
| `coingecko_coin_id` | `null` (not on CoinGecko yet) |
| Pool reserve (approx) | ~**$1** USD — **insufficient** |
| 24h volume | **$0** |

**Do not submit an Active Listing until** the PancakeSwap pool has meaningful depth and recurring trades (practical floor: at least several thousand USD reserves and non-zero daily volume over multiple days). CoinGecko rejects idle / dust pools.

- CoinGecko wants square PNG ≥ **200×200** (prefer 512×512). Upscale/export a clean 512 PNG before attach if the current asset is too small/pixelated.

### Short description (EN)
> Wrapped ACP (wACP) is the official BEP-20 representation of ACP on BNB Smart Chain. It is minted and burned 1:1 via the ANCAP bridge gateway so ACP can settle against BSC DeFi rails (starting with PancakeSwap wACP/USDT). Native ACP remains the ANCAP chain accounting unit; wACP is the wrapped market form. Not investment advice.

### Additional notes for reviewers
- Distinct from CoinGecko’s existing “ACP / Arena Of Faith” listing — different project, contract, and chain.
- Bridge gateway: `0x57c24FF77B23a82328cb88914D4FD4EEBd93321b`
- Official address index: <https://ancap.cloud> docs → `docs/OFFICIAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.md`
- Circulating / max supply: report from bridge + reserve APIs at submission time; do not invent FDV.

## Operator checklist

1. [ ] Seed PancakeSwap `wACP/USDT` liquidity (non-dust) and generate real volume for several days  
2. [ ] Confirm BscScan contract verification + logo clarity (512 PNG)  
3. [ ] Publish verification post on `@ancap24news`  
4. [ ] Submit Partners form with this fill sheet  
5. [ ] Reply with Request ID on the verification post  
6. [ ] After CoinGecko assigns a coin id, set env `COINGECKO_WACP_COIN_ID=<id>` (see `app/services/coingecko.py`) so `/v1/market/prices` uses the official CoinGecko feed  
7. [ ] sACP: separate listing only after DeploySacp + market  
8. [ ] Native ACP: only if/when CoinGecko supports the ANCAP L1 market feed

## What code already does

- Home ticker shows ACP / wACP / sACP + majors via `/api/v1/market/prices`.
- Until a CoinGecko coin id exists, wACP USD prefers **GeckoTerminal DEX spot** for the official pool, with desk rate as fallback.
- Legal disclosure: `/legal/market-data`.
